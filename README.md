The project got the idea from an application called 'three-line diary'.
The 'three-line diary' application is an application that allows you to record a day simply with one picture and three lines of content.
This project is also a useful web application for those who want to write a diary, although it is difficult to write a long text, when they want to record a day freely.

# Getting Started!
The project used LAMP (Linux + apache + Mysql + PHP) and raspberry pi.
1. Install the lamp on your Raspberry pi.
2. Clone the project under the directory of /var/www/html/.
3. In MySQL, create a database named 'oss_diary' and a 'diary' table as shown in the picture below.
