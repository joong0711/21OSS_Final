The project got the idea from an application called '3줄일기'(three-line diary).<br/>
The 'three-line diary' is an application that allows you to record a day simply with one picture and three lines of content.<br/>
This project is also a useful web application for those who want to write a diary, although it is difficult to write a long text, when they want to record a day freely.

# Getting Started!
The project used LAMP (Linux + apache + Mysql + PHP) and raspberry pi.<br/>
